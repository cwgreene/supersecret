# SuperSecret

A simple library to make it easy to store credentials, retrieve credentials,
and make it so that you don't accidentally commit said credentials to your public
git repo.

```python
# from ipython
import supersecret

supersecret.storeSecret("website.com", "username", "myname")
supersecret.storeSecret("website.com", "password", "mypassword")

# From your application
import supersecret

connect_to_website(username=supersecret.getSecret("website.com", "username"),
                   password=supersecret.getSecret("website.com", "password"))
```

You can also use `python -m supersecret` to list and store supersecret.

```
$ python -m supersecret store website.com username bob
$ python -m supersecret show website.com
```

The secrets are stored, unencrypted, in `~/.supersecret`.

## Installation

You can clone the repo and run

```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

Or you can install directly using pip and this repo

```shell
$ pip install git+git://github.com/cwgreene/supersecret.git
```

## Scopes

The first parameter in the above examples `"website.com"`
is called a scope. Each scope will correspond to a separate file in
`~/.supersecret`.

## Providers

`supersecret` allows you to use a different directory than `~/.supersecret`,
by using

```python
import supersecret

supersecret.provider = supersecret.FileSystemProvider("/path/to/other/directory")
```

It is *strongly* recommended that you do not put supersecret in your repo
directory, as this would allow for accidental commits of the supersecret
(which is the main thing this library is attempting to avoid). It is
probably also recommended not to have multiple user access to this
directory.

Theoretically, you can create a new provider class; checkout `supersecret.py`
for the required functions to be implemented. I'll probably make this
interface explicit sometime with inheritance.
